Models: deals with the database queries.
views->:allldesgn pages will be insides vies folder
controller:acting as an intermediator between models and views-

Note:
1)No page inside views is called directly, it is called through the controller function
2) every controller must extend the parent class CI_controller
3)every controller must have 1st function as index()
4)you cannot redeclare the same function inside a controller twice.

How to call the page in codeigniter :

->localhost/name of folder/index.php/nameof controller/function which is calling that page
--> here index.php is nothing but $config['index_page'] = 'index.php';
 written inside config file of config folder. we can set this to blank 
 if and only if we write mod_rewrite code,till then it would give out error 
 if u set  it to blank.
 
 configuration settings of codeigniter
 
	 for configuration settings u have go to application->config folder
		in which u have to make changes in following files:
		
		1)config.php file
			a)set the base_url at line 26
			$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost/acodeigniterpractice/';
			
			b)set the encryption key at 327
			$config['encryption_key'] = 'abcd
			we set this encryption key as we will be dealing with session .
			
			
		2)constants.php file

			define a constant inthis file at line no 32
			define('BASEURL','http://localhost/acodeigniterpractice/');
			
		3)database.php file
			here we mention the databse setting once the database is created.
			hostname' => 'localhost',
			'username' => 'root',
			'password' => '',
			'database' => '',
			
		4)routes.php
			this is the file where we maintain routes as well mention the default 
			controller name .
